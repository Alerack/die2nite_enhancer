- Adds keyboard shortcuts to quickly browse the important places (e.g.: the bank, the doors) ;
- Enables numeric stat on the hero experience bar ;
- Highlights the AP border (from green to red) depending of the remaining AP ;
- Sets the maximum number of AP for the constructions (instead of 1 by default) ;
- Hides completed constructions ;

It also allows you to synchronise with some external tools (from the game interface):
- Dusk Dawn (English external tool) ;
- Map Viewer (English external tool)

- Où en êtes-vous ? (French external tool).

Everything is adjustable through a configuration panel.
